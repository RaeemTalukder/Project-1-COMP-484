    <p> Support is the class archetype that aims to either heal or enchance the other memebers of the team. The main
        goal of a support is to keep the team alive and to empower them. They usually have low health and damage but
        compensate witht the ability to heal and empower which both damage and tank lack <textarea id="note" name="note"
            rows="1" cols="2" 
            readonly> Some supports have average to good health or damage output but trade healing potential</textarea>
        Without Support Tanks and Damage would always be widdled down to death without proper support keeping them
        afloat. The core two funtementals of a support is survival and empowerment.</p>
