            <p>Tank is the class archetype design to block damage and take space. Tanks usually are in the front line of
                the team "tanking" the damage for the rest of the team. They usually have high health and defense, but
                low damage output.<textarea id="note" name="note" rows="1" cols="2"
                    readonly> Some tanks have average to good damage output but usually it is only enough to force opponents back up and never meant to kill.</textarea>
                The tanks main goal is to hold position or space denying the opponent advangateous position. Without a
                Tank not only does damage have less space to work with almost always getting forced back due to their
                low health pools. Tanks should always stick to the two core funetmentals which is protecting the teama
                and taking space.</p>
