            <p> Damage, Damage per second (DPS), or attack damage carry (adc) is the class archeytype to deal the most
                damage and kill opponents. Their main goal is to be able to engage and kill opponents to reduce pressure
                put on tanks and supports. They usually have the down side of low health but with high damage output.
                Damage should always be looking for picks and flanks to create advantageous fights for their team.
                <textarea id="note" name="note" rows="1"
                    cols="2"> Some damage dealers have average to good amount of health but usually trade something else like range for that extra health</textarea>.
                Without damage the tank and support can't deal enough damage to kill anything which in turn forces them
                to move back because of lack of pressure and killing potential. Damage should always stick to the two
                funtementals of securing kills and pressuring the opponent to create space for the team. </p>
